# SUSA-Web-App

## Synopsis
This is the official web app for our Population Demography Project which is run by the UC Berkeley Statistics Undergraduate Student Association's Data Consulting Committee.

This is a web application using D3.js that will seek to emulate interactive graphs that professional organizations such as the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/15/us/politics/you-draw-obama-legacy.html)
use. 

More details TBA.
